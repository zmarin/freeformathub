          "question": "What's the difference between this and a regular news aggregator?",

        },
        {
          "question": "How do you ensure the generated content is original?",
          "answer": "Our AI analyzes the themes, context, and key points from multiple related discussions to create fresh perspectives and insights. We never copy-paste content - we synthesize and create original work based on the ideas and sentiments expressed by the community."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I use this content on my commercial website or blog?",
          "answer": "Yes, the generated content is yours to use however you wish - publish on blogs, use in newsletters, or enhance your content marketing. We recommend reviewing and editing the content to match your brand voice if needed."
        },
        {
          "question": "What makes the content SEO-friendly?",
          "answer": "We optimize for current search trends, use proper heading structures, include relevant keywords naturally, and create engaging content that encourages social sharing and longer page views - all while maintaining readability and value."
        },
        {
          "question": "How often should I generate new content?",
          "answer": "Tech trends change rapidly, so we recommend generating fresh content 2-3 times per week to stay current. Each article incorporates the latest discussions and sentiment from the developer community."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I specify the tone or style of the articles?",
          "answer": "Currently we generate professional, engaging technical content. However, we're working on adding customization options for tone (analytical vs conversational), length (short posts vs deep dives), and focus (technical vs business-oriented)."
        },
        {
          "question": "How accurate is the information in generated articles?",
          "answer": "We draw from real Hacker News discussions and verify facts against reliable sources. However, for critical technical information, we recommend cross-referencing with official documentation. Our goal is insightful analysis, not raw factual reporting."
